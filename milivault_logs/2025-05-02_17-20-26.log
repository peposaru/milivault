The squadron flew its first operational mission with the Marauder, a maritime reconnaissance mission on 26th October 1942. The squadron used its Marauders for long-range maritime reconnaissance missions, minelaying and anti-shipping attack with torpedoes over the Aegean. The squadron's Marauders sank a tanker with torpedoes on 19th January 1943 and two more merchant ships on 21st February. In March 1943, it started performing anti-submarine missions and long-range maritime reconnaissance missions, finding targets to be attacked by other anti-shipping units, operating out of Blida and then Maison Blanche in Algeria. In May 1943 the squadron supplemented its Marauders by six ex-USAAF P-51A Mustangs on loan, which equipped an additional flight for offensive operations, but these were returned to the USAAF in July, the squadron continuing to operate the Marauder.In June 1942, Eric now a seasoned member of the air crew was promoted to Flight Sergent, his duties included assisting the pilot, operating aircraft controls, advising on engine and system functions, and acting as a standby gunner. He was awarded his Mentioned in Despatches for distinguished service, this appeared in the London Gazette on the 14th January 1944.The squadron operated detachments in Italy and Sardinia, moving completely to Alghero in Sardinia in June 1944. In July 1944, the squadron began to operate maritime patrol operations in conjunction with the Bristol Beaufighters of 39 Squadron, with a Marauder cruising offshore and directing Beaufighters to attack any shipping spotted. The squadron flew its last Marauder mission on 21st September that year, leaving its equipment behind when it transferred back to the UK.The squadron operated within RAF Coastal Command from 24 October 1944. On its return to the UK, the squadron was based at RAF Chivenor and carried out anti-submarine mission over the Western Approaches and the Bay of Biscay using Vickers Wellington Mk.XIVs. The squadron was again disbanded on 1 June 1945 but was reborn the same day, when 143 Squadron at RAF Banff, equipped with the de Havilland Mosquito Mk.VI in the anti-shipping strike role, was renumbered. This incarnation of the squadron was short lived, being disbanded on 31 March 1946.Eric was finally discharged on the 24th May 1949. It was more than likely that he spent his last three years as training staff.A wonderful complete lot, the medals are loose and were once mounted in a frame with badges etc, which sadly was broken.

Then in April 1941, following the liberation of Addis Ababa, the squadron was sent to Egypt for operations over the Western Desert. The squadron was deployed in support of Operation Brevity on 15thth–16 May 1941, an unsuccessful British offensive, and carried out attacks on German and Italian motor transport, with five Blenheims being shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters of III Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 27 while carrying out bombing attacks along the Tobruk–Capuzzo road on 21st May.The squadron flew attacks against Maleme Airfield on 25th and 27th May during the Battle of Crete, and in June, flew in support of Operation Battleaxe, another unsuccessful British offensive in the Western Desert.

Street. 2nd East Surrey regiment.Albert Thomas Street was born in Dorking Surrey on 14th September 1852, son of John and Mary Street, John a Cordwainer (Shoemaker) and Albert was employed as a Clerk before joining the regiment.He enlisted into the 31st regiment of foot on 28th September 1880 at Reigate Surrey stating his age as 24, but he was really 27 years old. After a period of training and home service he was posted to India in the October of 1881, assigned to the now 2nd East Surrey regiment after the Childers Reforms of 1881. He was a good soldier earning a good conduct strip and a 1d raise in pay on 14th July 1883 and he was shortly after promoted to Lance Corporal in the November the same year being posted to Singapore. But overseas service really did not suit Albert, spending a lot of his time in hospital with Dysentery and fever and was reverted to the rank of Private.If we now fast forward to 1884, he was posted with his regiment to Egypt and sailed on HMS Himalaya on the 9th of September, arriving at Abbasiyah on the 26th of the same month and later on to Suakin, disembarking on the 24th March 1885, the 2nd expedition.Following the fall of Khartoum on 26th January 1885,  Major-General Sir Gerald Graham led a second expedition in March 1885. This expedition is sometimes referred to as the Suakin Field Force, its purpose was to defeat Mahdist forces under Osman Digna in the region and to supervise and protect the construction of the Suakin-Berber Railway. A week after its arrival in Suakin, the expedition fought in two actions: the Battle of Hashin on 20th March, and the Battle of Tofrek on 22nd March fighting the formidable Dervishes.After returning home later that year, he was awarded his second good conduct stripe and on the 8th December 1886 he once again embarked for India, this time on HMS Serapis, landing on the 5th January 1887. For some reason Albert did not do well in this type of Climate, especially when he was admitted to hospital with starvation having been lost on the Jungle for nine days, living on just water. He also suffered cuts and sores from sleeping in the trees and all of his nails had fallen out due to malnutrition.But he recovered and remained in India for another three years suffering considerably from the effects of the climate and spending much time in hospital on several occasions suffering from fever and finally Hepatitis being discharged from the army on 18th December 1892.From his discharge we lose track of him, however there is a Albert Street with the same date and place of birth in the Dorking Union Workhouse as an inmate in 1911. By this time this was mainly an Infirmary for the poor. It is highly likely that this is Albert, who was probably in ill health after he left the army.The Egypt medal is in very good order with contact marks to one side, as he is also entitled to the Khedives Star, which was probably mounted with this medal.It comes with a whole host of copied paperwork including service papers and award rolls etc.

This expedition is sometimes referred to as the Suakin Field Force, its purpose was to defeat Mahdist forces under Osman Digna in the region and to supervise and protect the construction of the Suakin-Berber Railway. A week after its arrival in Suakin, the expedition fought in two actions: the Battle of Hashin on 20th March, and the Battle of Tofrek on 22nd March fighting the formidable Dervishes.After returning home later that year, he was awarded his second good conduct stripe and on the 8th December 1886 he once again embarked for India, this time on HMS Serapis, landing on the 5th January 1887. For some reason Albert did not do well in this type of Climate, especially when he was admitted to hospital with starvation having been lost on the Jungle for nine days, living on just water. He also suffered cuts and sores from sleeping in the trees and all of his nails had fallen out due to malnutrition.But he recovered and remained in India for another three years suffering considerably from the effects of the climate and spending much time in hospital on several occasions suffering from fever and finally Hepatitis being discharged from the army on 18th December 1892.From his discharge we lose track of him, however there is a Albert Street with the same date and place of birth in the Dorking Union Workhouse as an inmate in 1911. By this time this was mainly an Infirmary for the poor.
