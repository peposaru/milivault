                'Emergency Corps), was originally established in September '
                '1919, of trained, voluntary, civilian personnel to maintain '
                'and repair essential services in\xa0the\xa0event of a natural '
                'disaster or emergency. Many of its personnel were ex-service '
                'men, and a large amount of them had some type of specialized '
                'technical training which was key to its mandate. TeNo was a '
                'civilian organization administered under the Minister of the '
                'Interior, until mid-1939, when it became an official State '
                'organization under control of the Police, which in turn was '
                'controlled by the SS. With this change in status, a small '
                'nucleus of salaried officials was employed to run the '
                'organization. As the war dragged on, TeNo became increasingly '
                'a para-military organization with its direction becoming more '
                'controlled by the Waffen-SS.',

2025-04-04 13:38:44,352 - DEBUG - CLEAN DESCRIPTION: Raw input → German WWII Rare TeNo Fender Pennant-This is a dark blue ribbed cloth pennant with a silver embroidered TENO emblem and eagle. The body of the pennant displays some slight damage, probably from use. This measures 9” (23cm) wide by 14” (35.5cm) long. There is a metal mounting loop remaining on lower corner, the top loop is broken off and missing.History: TeNo, Technischen Nothilfe (Technical Emergency Corps), was originally established in September 1919, of trained, voluntary, civilian personnel to maintain and repair essential services in the event of a natural disaster or emergency. Many of its personnel were ex-service men, and a large amount of them had some type of specialized technical training which was key to its mandate. TeNo was a civilian organization administered under the Minister of the Interior, until mid-1939, when it became an official State organization under control of the Police, which in turn was controlled by the SS. With this change in status, a small nucleus of salaried officials was employed to run the organization. As the war dragged on, TeNo became increasingly a para-military organization with its direction becoming more controlled by the Waffen-SS.
